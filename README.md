My third year project
=====================

The aim is to find similarly connected nodes in graphs.


Repository structure
====================


    brute/
        Initial brute-force implementation in Matlab.

    cpp/
        Small experiment with Armadillo C++ library.

    docs/
        Documents, used and unused. Includes some figures, and the original project brief.

    eigen/
        Matlab approximative approach implementation.

    eval/
        Evaluation results (saved from the cmd.py trev output).
        They might not be computed with the latest version of trev.

    graphviz/
        Generating GEFX files with Matlab experiment.

    py/
        Python implementation of the approximative approach and relevant command line tools, including cmd.py.

    reports/
        Interim and final reports. PDF and .tex source.

    sigma/
        Sigma.js experiments. Used to render Figure 1 in final report (/reports/final/img/frame[0-5].*)
